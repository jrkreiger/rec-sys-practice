# Recommendation Systems Practicee
Practice with recommendation systems (with Surprise)

In this repo I'm getting some practice with recommendation systems, specifically with the Python package Surprise.

This repo contains:

* **rec-system.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code focused on a continuous-scale dataset
* **rec-system-2.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code focused on a discrete scale dataset
* **user_artists.dat**: the Last.FM dataset, acquired from [https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/).

This is a work in progress. Check back occasionally for updates.
